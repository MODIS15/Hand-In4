\section{Assignment 15.1}
An unreliable failure detector may  produce one or two values when given the identity of a process, which can either be Unsuspected or Suspected. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Unsuspected} The detector has recently received evidence suggesting that the process has not failed. By way of example, a message may recently have been received from it. The process may have failed since.
	
	\item{Suspected} The detector may have some indication that the process has failed. By way of example, a process may not have received any message for a prolonged timeframe that exceeds a nominal maximum length of silence. The reason may be that the network has been slow while the process is still functioning.
\end{itemize}


Both of these may or may not accurately reflect whether the process has actually failed
