\section{Assignment 15.3}
One can express the relation between maximum throughput and syncronization delay in a mutual exclusion system with the following formula below. It expresses the maximum throughput of critical-section-entries per second.
\begin{align} \label{equationMaxThrouput}
	Assume:\\
	s = synchronization\ delay\\
	m = writing\ time\\
	t_m = maximum\ througput\\\\
	t_m=1\div(s+m)
\end{align}
