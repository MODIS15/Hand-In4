\section{Assignment 15.23}
Assume the system has 3 generals. One of these is treacherous. Also, assume a signature cannot be forged and everyone can validate the authenticity of a signature.

\begin{itemize}
	\item All generals send their conclusion to all other lieutenants. 
	\item Each lieutenant forwards the received orders to the other lieutenants.
\end{itemize}

It is now possible to determine which lieutenant was faulty based on the signature since, by the assumption, one is not able to forge signatures when forwarding messages.
